/**
 * The shared cancellation check applied at every orchestrator boundary — the "two-question pattern".
 *
 * Asks: (1) has cancellation fired on the call, or the deadline elapsed? (2) does the response in
 * hand already carry a cancellation status? If either is true, a cancellation response is returned
 * to fast-exit up the stack; otherwise `null` signals "continue normally".
 *
 * Pre-check (before delegation): a fired cancellation either overlays the existing response's status
 * (preserving accumulated metadata) or, when no response exists yet, builds a fresh one. Post-check
 * (after delegation): a returned cancellation response passes through unchanged.
